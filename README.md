## 📌 Assignment Overview

This project covers four key areas of Artificial Intelligence:

1. Search Algorithms
2. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
3. Game Playing (Adversarial Search)
4. Reinforcement Learning

All solutions are implemented in Python and organised into separate folders per question.

# 🧠 Question 1: Warehouse Search (Informed Search)

### 🔍 Description

A warehouse robot must navigate from a **start point (A)** to a **goal (B)** while avoiding obstacles.

### ⚙️ Algorithms Used

* Greedy Best-First Search
* A* Search

### 📏 Heuristic

Euclidean Distance:

$$
h(n) = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}
$$

### 📊 Output

* `warehouse_path.png` → A* result
* `warehouse_path_greedy.png` → Greedy result

# 📡 Question 2: Telecommunication Tower Placement (CSP)

### 🔍 Description

Place 8 towers on a 10×10 grid while satisfying spatial and terrain constraints.

### ⚙️ Techniques Used

* Backtracking
* Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)
* Forward Checking

### 🚧 Constraints

* No same row or column
* No adjacent placement (including diagonals)
* No placement on mountain cells

### 🧪 Test Files

* `test_level1.py` (Easy)
* `test_level2.py` (Medium)
* `test_level3.py` (Hard)
